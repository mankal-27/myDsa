# DSA Patterns & Resources

A personal repository for studying Data Structures and Algorithms — organized by pattern, with animations and reference material for each concept.

## Goal

Build pattern-based intuition for DSA (not just solve random problems) by pairing each pattern with visual explanations and curated resources.

## Structure

```
my_dsa/

├── patterns/       # One folder per pattern (two-pointers, sliding-window, etc.)
├── resources/       # Links, notes, and reference material per concept
├── animations/       # Visualizations/animations used to build intuition
└── problems/       # Practice problems mapped to each pattern
```

Each problem folder follows the same layout: a `README.md`, the solution file, and a `*.test.js` file. Run `npm test` from the repo root to run every test.

### DSA WarmUp Modules

| Module | Folder | Status | Problems |
|---|---|---|---|
| Variables & I/O Operations | `1_Variables_Io_Operations/` | Complete | Swap Two Numbers, Temperature Converter, Simple & Compound Interest, Convert Seconds to H/M/S, Absolute Value Without Built-in, Quotient & Remainder of Division, Area & Perimeter of Shapes |
| Conditionals & Decision Making | `2_Conditionals_Dec/` | Complete | Even or Odd, Positive/Negative/Zero, Leap Year Check, Grade from Marks, Valid Triangle from Three Sides, Vowel or Consonant, Check if Three Points are Collinear |
| Loops & Iteration | `3_Loops_Iteration/` | In progress | Print Numbers from 1 to N |

### Problem README Template

Every problem's `README.md` covers:

1. **Problem Statement** — the prompt, examples, and constraints.
2. **Use Case** — where this concept/technique actually shows up (real systems, other algorithms, common interview follow-ups) — not just "how" but "why it matters."
3. **Concepts** — the specific language/DSA concepts the problem exercises.
4. **Approach(es)** — brute force first, then optimized (and any bonus approaches), each with:
   - **Intuition** — the reasoning that leads to this approach, in plain language, before any code.
   - **Solution** — the code.
   - **Dry Run** — a step-by-step trace through a concrete example, showing how the variables change.
5. **Complexity** — time and space complexity in Big-O notation for every approach, with a short justification (not just the notation).
